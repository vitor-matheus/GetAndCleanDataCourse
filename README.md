##  This is a repository created for the course Getting and Cleaning Data from Coursera, by Johns Hopkins Uni. My name is Vitor Moraes.  

## The used data set is:
### [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)  

## Important Files
### Inside **GetAndCleanDataCourse** you can find the *CodeBook.md* which has all the information about the coding arround tidying this dataset and this README.md you're reading right now =D. You will also find the *run_analysis.R* script that I used and the *FinalData.txt* with the final result.  
## *run_analysis.R*
### 1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
### 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
### 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
### 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
### 5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
